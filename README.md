This repo contains a project to use JSBSim in Godot 4.
It originates from following repo https://github.com/chunky/jsbgodot/tree/master/demo that was made for Godot 3.
Work in early progress. But compiles and can run in Godot 4.3.
JSBsim is a submodule. Not sure why github.com is not reflecting this.
